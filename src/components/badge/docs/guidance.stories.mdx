# Guidance
Badges are status modifiers to other elements which display the numerical
value within an element either next to it or inside the element itself.
Badges have a colorful, bold, and filled style that makes them stand out when appearing within or next to another component.
Badges are also small enough to fit next to or within another element.

## Content
Use integers within badges. If youâ€™re attempting to use text, consider using a `m-tag` instead.
